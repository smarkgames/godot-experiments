# Godot Experiments

Just a collection of various experiments I am doing in Godot. All of these start with Godot 4.2-rc2 and all scripts are done with GDScript. Any assets used in these experiments that aren't already free, will be referenced with url to download from the creators, but not commited to the repository.

## About Me

I have be writing code since 1982 and I still have the Apple ][+ that I started on. Writing software is all I have ever done as a career and I still do it full time to this day. My oldest got his BA in Game Design from DigiPen in 2023 and that is what rekindled my interest in building games.

## Some Background

As I have been writing software professionally for longer than most people reading this have been alive, I dont take shortcuts. This means my hope is this codebase is free from hacks, magic values, paths, etc. One important thing to me is that no one should ever suffer from NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome. That means that if (as an example) I am looking to experiment with a dialog system and a community add-on that ticks the boxes exists and has customizable look and feel, I will without hestitation reach for it. There are going to be times an experiment will be coded from hand vs using an off the shelf, purley to help me understand the inner workings of godot. A save/load game system is a good example of this case.

## Price & License

Free, always and forever and unrestricted. If anything is useful here and helps you in your projects, please by all means use it! This is currently MIT licensed as I am not seeking credit or cash, though shoutouts are much loved :)

I do ask that if you use any other creators work (assets, fonts, sounds, plugins, etc) in your projects, please include references/links to those assets.
